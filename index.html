                        A “rape kit” is a term commonly used to describe an evidence collection process. The proper term for a rape kit is a sexual assault forensic exam (SAFE). The Violence Against Womxn Act requires states to provide this exam free of charge.
                        The kit itself is a collection of forensic tools, papers, and containers. 
                        Trained staff use this kit to collect possible evidence from a crime scene, personal belongings, or clothes.

                    <p class="inner-body">To begin, a specifically trained medical professional will conduct a full physical exam. Including a <a href=" https://www.healthline.com/health/navigating-medical-exams-after-sexual-assault">pelvic exam</a>.</p>
                    <p class="inner-body">The evidence collected during this forensic exam can be used to prosecute the person or persons who assaulted you. To get the most evidence, you should have this exam within 72 hours of the assault.  You don’t have to do this if you don’t want to. You can also stop, pause, or skip parts of the exam at any point.</p>
                    <p class="inner-body">Collecting the data for a rape kit doesn’t mean you have to inform the police. The medical facility that has your kit can turn it over to law enforcement with an anonymous identification number. They’ll give you this number so you can check for results and, if you do decide to talk to the police, help them connect the results with your case.</p>
                    <p class="inner-body">Law enforcement is required to store rape kits for a set amount of time. That length of time depends on state and local laws. 
                        Some store it for a few years, others for decades. Some states will process the kit even if you don’t intend to press charges.
                         The data could be added to a national database, which could help law enforcement officials around the country.

                    <p class="inner-body">
                        If you don’t want to talk to the police, you don’t have to. A rape kit doesn’t change that. A rape kit is a way
                         for you to preserve possible evidence in the event you decide you want to report. Most states require law 
                         enforcement officials to hold the kits for several years. You have time to make a decision if you don’t 
                         immediately know what you want to do.

                        In most states, healthcare providers and advocates are required by law to report an assault 
                        if the person is under 18 years old.

                    <p class="inner-body">
                        You may have several legal questions after a sexual assault. You may want to ask about the 
                        process of filing a report and going through an investigation.
                        If the case goes to trial, you may want legal counseling, too.
                        Some legal resources are available free of charge. Others may provide services for discounted prices.
